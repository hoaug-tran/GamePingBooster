///     service reports a new expiry. A one-minute timer asking "is it time yet" 720 times to do
///     one HTTP call is the shape of code that ends up in a profiler.
///   - it does not touch a live tunnel. A new token applies from the next connect; the session
///     in progress was authorised when it started and the relay caps its age anyway. Dropping a
///     player out of a match to present a credential buys nothing.
