.SYNOPSIS
    One entry point for everything done day to day on this project.

.DESCRIPTION
    The work was spread across four long commands in four directories, each with a path nobody
    can remember, and two of them pointed at different build outputs for no reason - the service
    ran from bin\Debug while the UI ran from a Release publish. This collapses them into verbs.

    Run it from anywhere:

        .\gpb.ps1 dev                 build and start the service (as LocalSystem) plus the UI
        .\gpb.ps1 stop                stop both
        .\gpb.ps1 capture [game] [udp|tcp|all]  watch for the game and collect server addresses
                                      (udp); tcp/all also report which lobby/login connections
                                      never answered, into tcp-sessions.txt - never the profile
        .\gpb.ps1 profile [game]      rebuild that game's profile from what was captured
        .\gpb.ps1 check               is the game actually going through the relay right now
        .\gpb.ps1 lag [seconds]       run this DURING the lag: which segment is at fault
        .\gpb.ps1 logs                follow the service log
        .\gpb.ps1 status              read the tunnel's live counters
        .\gpb.ps1 test                every test on both sides
        .\gpb.ps1 publish             Native AOT build and install into ProgramData
        .\gpb.ps1 diag                collect a diagnostics bundle to send
        .\gpb.ps1 installer [version] publish, then package a setup .exe (needs Inno Setup 6)
        .\gpb.ps1 version [x.y.z]     show or set the version everything is stamped with
        .\gpb.ps1 reset               remove EVERYTHING this software installed, to test setup

        .\gpb.ps1 relay build         cross-compile relayd for Linux
        .\gpb.ps1 relay list          show the relays gpb.conf declares
        .\gpb.ps1 relay deploy [name] build, upload and install on a relay
                                      the mode comes from gpb.conf; --psk or --token asserts it
        .\gpb.ps1 relay logs [name]   follow journalctl on a relay
        .\gpb.ps1 relay test          Go tests only

        .\gpb.ps1 release x.y.z       bump VERSION, commit, push main and the tag; GitHub Actions
                                      then builds and publishes the release. Never publish a
                                      release on the GitHub web page - see .github/workflows/release.yml

    Relays are declared in gpb.conf - host, port, user, key or password, one block each. Copy
    gpb.conf.example to gpb.conf and fill it in; see `.\gpb.ps1 relay setup`.

    Games are declared in tools\profile-builder\games.json - which process to watch, which files
    to write, which cloud regions an address may belong to. Leave the game out and the file's
    "default" is used, which is what `capture` and `profile` always did. That file is committed;
    gpb.conf is not.

.EXAMPLE
    .\gpb.ps1 dev
    The usual starting point: everything built and running.

<#
.SYNOPSIS
    Starts the UI as the LOGGED-IN user, even when this script is running elevated.
.DESCRIPTION
    `dev` has to be run from an Administrator terminal, because psexec needs it. A plain
    Start-Process from there hands the UI the elevated token as well - and that is wrong in a way
    that hides bugs rather than causing them.

    The whole privilege split rests on the UI being unprivileged: the named pipe's ACL is opened
    to BuiltinUsers precisely so that a normal-user UI can drive a LocalSystem service, and the
    installer starts the UI with `runasoriginaluser` for the same reason. A dev loop that runs the
    UI elevated therefore never exercises the boundary that production depends on. It also makes
    the app untouchable from an ordinary shell - UIPI refuses even WM_CLOSE from a lower
    integrity level, with ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED - which is how this was noticed.

    Going through explorer.exe is the trick that does it without a token-manipulation helper:
    Explorer runs as the interactive user, so the process it launches does too. It gives back no
    process handle, hence the poll rather than a return value. If it does not appear, fall back to
    launching directly and say plainly what that means, because a UI that does not start at all is
    worse than one running at the wrong integrity level.

Setting up a relay, start to finish.

1. Declare it in gpb.conf. Copy the example and edit one block - host, and whichever of user,
   port, key or password your VPS needs. The name in the middle of the key is yours to pick and
   is what you type on the command line:

    copy gpb.conf.example gpb.conf

    RELAY_SG_HOST=203.0.113.10
    RELAY_SG_USER=root
    RELAY_SG_KEY=~/.ssh/id_ed25519
    RELAY_DEFAULT=sg

   gpb.conf is gitignored. Check what got read:

    .\gpb.ps1 relay list

2. If you have no key yet, make one and install it. Once per host, and the last time you type
   that password:

    ssh-keygen -t ed25519
    type `$env:USERPROFILE\.ssh\id_ed25519.pub | ssh root@203.0.113.10 "mkdir -p ~/.ssh && chmod 700 ~/.ssh && cat >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys && chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys"

   A password in RELAY_<NAME>_PASSWORD works instead, and costs one prompt-free deploy, but it
   sits in plain text on your disk. gpb.conf.example says more about that trade.

3. Deploy. This builds relayd, ships it in one connection and runs install.sh on the far end:

    .\gpb.ps1 relay deploy sg          (or just .\gpb.ps1 relay deploy, for RELAY_DEFAULT)
    .\gpb.ps1 relay logs sg

   An account that is not root needs sudo for the install step, which the deploy works out on
   the far end. If sudo wants a password it uses RELAY_<NAME>_SUDO_PASSWORD, or the login
   password when that is empty, and asks you on the terminal if there is neither.

4. install.sh prints the endpoint and the PSK. They go into two different files, because they
   are two different things:

    endpoint <ip>:51820  ->  profiles\<profile>.json, as an entry in "relays"
    PSK                  ->  client\config.json, as "psk"

   Neither belongs in gpb.conf: that file is only about reaching the VPS.
