    // configuration from; the service owns that file and writes it on the UI's behalf.

    // never the key - the pipe is open to BuiltinUsers, so anything readable here is readable by
    // any process running as the user. Sending a key in is a nuisance; letting one be read out
    // would be a credential leak.

    // ------------------------------------------------------------------ set-token
    //
    // The sixth verb, and the second one carrying data. The UI signs in to the licence server,
    // is handed a 150-byte token, and pushes it down here because the service is the half that
    // presents it at handshake time and the half that can write %ProgramData%.
    //
    // WRITE-ONLY, for the same reason as the key in set-relay: the pipe is open to BuiltinUsers,
    // so anything readable over it is readable by any process running as the user. StatusMessage
    // reports whether a token exists and when it expires - never the token.
    //
    // Pushing a token is not the same as being authorised. The relay verifies the signature
    // against the licence server's public key, so the worst a hostile local process achieves is
    // making the tunnel present a token it already had.

    //
    // The seventh verb. The UI fetches the profile and pushes it down; the service does not
    // fetch it itself, and the split is not arbitrary.
    //
    // The licence server authenticates the profile request with the account's refresh token.
    // That credential belongs to the PERSON, is wrapped with DPAPI at USER scope, and lives in
    // the signed-in user's own profile directory. The service runs as LocalSystem and cannot
    // read it - nor should it: pulling a user credential across that boundary to save an IPC
    // message would widen the one privilege boundary this project keeps narrow.
    //
    // Unlike the key and the token, the profile is not write-only, because it is not a secret in
    // the first place: RouteManager turns every CIDR in it into a Windows route, so anyone can
    // read the whole list back with Get-NetRoute while the tunnel is up. Sending it over a pipe
