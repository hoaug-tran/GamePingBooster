/// Why this must be a service running as LocalSystem rather than a UI app running as
/// Administrator: Wintun requires LocalSystem to create the virtual adapter - Administrator is
/// not enough. The split also buys two more things: the user never sees a UAC prompt when
/// opening the app, and a UI crash does not tear down a running tunnel.
///
/// Run in console mode for debugging:  gpb-service.exe --console
///
/// The installer calls two more, both as SYSTEM and both before any configuration exists:
///
///   gpb-service.exe --install-driver     put the Wintun driver in place during setup
///   gpb-service.exe --remove-driver      take it away again at uninstall
///
/// And one for support and development, which prints this machine's device public key:
///
///   gpb-service.exe --device-key
