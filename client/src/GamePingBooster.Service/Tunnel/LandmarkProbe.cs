/// Which datacentre the game is going to put this player in, measured rather than assumed.
///
/// Online games decide that for themselves: before a match PUBG probes one endpoint per Azure
/// region on UDP 8081, Valve SDR checks regional coordinator clusters, and they pick the nearest.
/// Those endpoints are stable across sessions - unlike gameplay servers, which are allocated per match
/// and never repeat - so they can be written into the profile as a <see cref="RegionEntry.Landmarks"/> list
/// and used as a stand-in for the region itself. They sit in the region they represent and they answer
/// ICMP, which is all this needs.
///
/// Two things are measured with them, and the difference matters:
///
///   - here, over the PHYSICAL path, to work out which region the game will choose. That has to
///     be the honest ISP path, because that is what the game measures too (see the decision in
///     HANDOFF section 6a). Get this wrong and we compare relays against the wrong destination.
///   - in <see cref="TunnelClient.MeasureThroughTunnelAsync"/>, through each candidate tunnel,
///     to work out what the player's ping will actually be on that relay.
///
/// A region with no landmarks cannot be ranked and is left out. That is not a failure: it means
/// the profile has not recorded a probe endpoint for it yet, and the caller falls back to
/// comparing relays on the first leg alone, which is what this client did before any of this
/// existed.
