# Game Ping Booster

Low-latency network optimizer for Counter-Strike 2 (CS2) and PUBG on Windows, aimed at players in Vietnam and Southeast Asia. Gameplay traffic is diverted
through a high-speed VPS abroad whose route to the game servers beats the one the local ISP picks by default.

Supports automatic game detection (accelerates whichever game is running, like GearUP / ExitLag) as well as manual game selection via the UI.

No injection, no reading game memory, no DLL hooks. The whole mechanism is a virtual network
adapter plus entries in the Windows routing table: destinations belonging to the game go through
the tunnel, everything else keeps using the normal path. Detecting that the game is running means
listing processes, exactly as Task Manager does.

## Layout

```
relay/     Go         -> runs on a Linux VPS
client/    C# .NET 9  -> runs on the player's machine (Avalonia UI + Windows Service)
profiles/  JSON       -> game IP ranges, fetched at runtime
tools/     PowerShell -> build and validate profiles
docs/                 -> design documentation
```

## Where to start

| You want | Read |
|---|---|
| The system as a whole | [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) |
| The wire protocol | [docs/PROTOCOL.md](docs/PROTOCOL.md) |
| Deploying and operating the relay | [relay/README.md](relay/README.md) |
| The virtual adapter binary | [client/native/wintun/README.md](client/native/wintun/README.md) |

## How the game's addresses are found

Routing works on destination addresses, so the profile has to say which addresses belong to the
game - and it has to be narrow. AWS and Azure publish the enclosing blocks as `/17`s and `/18`s;
routing one of those would drag thousands of unrelated services through the relay.

`tools/profile-builder/` provides builders for both games:

```powershell
cd tools\profile-builder

# For CS2: fetch live Valve SDR POPs directly from the Steam API:
.\Build-Cs2Profile.ps1

# For PUBG: capture and build from observed sessions:
.\Capture-GameTraffic.ps1     # leave running, play, Ctrl+C when done
.\Build-PubgProfile.ps1       # no arguments
```

For CS2, all 41+ Valve Steam Datagram Relay (SDR) clusters are fetched directly from the official Steam Web API and mapped to dedicated /24 subnets.
For PUBG, the tool watches the game process, attributes traffic from the socket table, cross-checks against Azure/AWS ranges, and writes `profiles/pubg-vn.json`.

Addresses that belong to no published cloud range are never added automatically; they are set
aside for review. In practice they turn out to be voice chat or a CDN.

## Build

**Relay** (needs Go 1.22+, builds from Windows or Linux):

```bash
cd relay && make build && make test
```

**Client** (needs the .NET 9 SDK). Two builds, for two different jobs:

```bash
./gpb dev        # Debug build, then starts the service and the UI. The everyday loop.
./gpb publish    # Native AOT Release build, installed into %ProgramData%
```

`./gpb dev` is what you want while working. It stops anything already running, builds, and
starts the service through `psexec -s -i` - Wintun refuses to create an adapter for anything
below LocalSystem, and Administrator is not enough.

`./gpb publish` produces the real thing: a Native AOT executable that is machine code, needs no
.NET runtime on the user's PC, and starts immediately. It additionally needs **Visual Studio
Build Tools** with the "Desktop development with C++" workload.

Underneath it is just `dotnet publish`, and you can run that directly:

```bash
cd client && dotnet publish src/GamePingBooster.Service -c Release -r win-x64
cd client && dotnet publish src/GamePingBooster.App -c Release -r win-x64
```

...but `./gpb publish` also does three things that are easy to miss and whose failures name the
wrong cause:

- **Puts `vswhere.exe` on PATH first.** Native AOT needs the MSVC linker and finds it through
  `vswhere`, which is not on PATH by default. Without it the publish dies with
  `'vswhere.exe' is not recognized`, which says nothing about AOT.
- **Stops the service and the UI first.** The service holds `wintun.dll` and the UI holds
  `Core.dll`; a build that cannot overwrite them fails with a locked-file error that does not
  mention either.
- **Copies the result into `%ProgramData%\GamePingBooster\bin`**, skipping `.pdb` files.

A registered service keeps running the old binary until it is restarted, which needs
Administrator:

```
sc.exe stop GamePingBooster
sc.exe start GamePingBooster
```

## Commands

Everything day to day goes through one entry point. `./gpb` is POSIX `sh` and runs on Linux,
macOS and Git Bash; `gpb.ps1` is the same set of verbs for PowerShell. `./gpb` hands the
Windows-only verbs to `gpb.ps1` when you are on Windows, and explains itself rather than failing
strangely when you are not.

Run them from `application/`. `./gpb` with no arguments prints this list.

### Relay - works on any operating system

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `./gpb relay setup` | First-time setup, explained step by step. Start here. |
| `./gpb relay list` | The relays `gpb.conf` declares, how each one authenticates, and the endpoint a client would use. Use it to check what actually got parsed. |
| `./gpb relay build` | Cross-compiles `relayd` for Linux. Static, no cgo, so the VPS never needs Go. |
| `./gpb relay deploy [name]` | Builds, ships and installs in **one** ssh connection - the payload goes over as a tar stream on stdin. Omit the name to use `RELAY_DEFAULT`. |
| `./gpb relay logs [name]` | Follows `journalctl -u relayd -f` on that relay. |
| `./gpb relay test` | Go tests only. |

`./gpb relay` on its own prints that table.

Relays are declared in `gpb.conf` (copy `gpb.conf.example`; it is gitignored and no host in this
repository is real). A name that file does not declare is handed to `ssh` unchanged, so an alias
from your `~/.ssh/config` or a plain `root@203.0.113.10` works too.

#### What a relay block holds

One block per VPS. Only `_HOST` is required; every other field has the default shown.

| Key | Default | What it is |
|---|---|---|
| `RELAY_<NAME>_HOST` | - | Address or DNS name of the VPS. **Required.** |
| `RELAY_<NAME>_USER` | `root` | SSH user. |
| `RELAY_<NAME>_PORT` | `22` | SSH port. |
| `RELAY_<NAME>_KEY` | - | Private key file for SSH. `~/` is expanded, so one line works from PowerShell and from Git Bash. |
| `RELAY_<NAME>_PASSWORD` | `RELAY_PASSWORD` | SSH password, when there is no key. |
| `RELAY_<NAME>_SUDO_PASSWORD` | the SSH password | Only when they differ - key-based login plus a sudo password, usually. |
| `RELAY_<NAME>_LISTEN` | `51820` | UDP port relayd listens on. This is the port a **player** connects to, not the SSH one. |
| `RELAY_<NAME>_MAX` | `0` | How many clients this relay accepts **at once**. 0 means no limit beyond the address pool. |

`gpb.conf` is **parsed, not sourced**, on both sides, so a password may contain a space, `#`, `$`
or a backslash. `./gpb relay list` prints what actually got parsed, including the client cap -
worth a look after editing, because a value that failed to parse reads exactly like one that was
never set.

#### How many clients a relay accepts

`RELAY_<NAME>_MAX` becomes `-max-clients` on the relay, and a client arriving past it is answered
with "the relay is full" and fails over to another relay rather than being left hanging.

A count, rather than a smaller `-subnet`, on purpose. A prefix gives whatever the arithmetic
gives - a `/26` is 61 usable addresses, not 50 - and `-subnet` also has to agree with
`setup-nat.sh` and with the client, which assumes a `/24` when it configures the tunnel adapter.
Leaving the subnet alone and saying the number out loud avoids all of that.

Without it, the ceiling is the address pool: a `/24` leaves **253** clients at once, after the
network address, the relay's own `.1` and the broadcast.

#### Sharing one key between relays

Every relay a client might reach must hold the **same** pre-shared key, or failing over from one
to another is refused by the second. `install.sh` generates a key only when the machine has none,
so a redeploy never disturbs one; to put an existing key on a new relay, hand it a file:

```
sudo ./install.sh --psk-file /path/to/key
```

A file rather than a flag value, because a key on the command line is visible in `ps` to every
user on the box while the script runs. `GPB_PSK` also works, but **only** when `install.sh` runs
as root directly - `sudo` resets the environment, so `GPB_PSK=... sudo ./install.sh` loses it and
quietly generates a new key instead.

An account that is not root is fine: the payload unpacks into `~/.gpb-deploy`, and only the
install step needs privilege. It runs directly when the account is root, under `sudo` when sudo
is passwordless, and otherwise over a second connection that can carry a sudo password - the
first one cannot, because its stdin is the tarball and `sudo -S` reads its password from stdin.

### Client - Windows only

These drive a virtual adapter, the routing table, a Windows service and Npcap. They have no
meaning on another system and say so instead of failing oddly.

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `./gpb dev` | The everyday loop: stop what is running, build, start the service as LocalSystem via `psexec`, start the UI. |
| `./gpb publish` | Native AOT Release build, installed into `%ProgramData%\GamePingBooster\bin`. See [Build](#build). |
| `./gpb stop` | Stops the service and the UI. |
| `./gpb status` | Asks the running service for its live counters over the named pipe: state, packets, drops, tunnel ping, loss, active routes. |
| `./gpb logs` | Follows the service log in `%ProgramData%\GamePingBooster\logs`. |
| `./gpb check` | **Run this during a match.** Answers whether the game's traffic is really going through the relay or straight out of the network card. Outside a match it has nothing to look at. |
| `./gpb lag [seconds]` | **Run this while it is lagging.** Pings every segment of the path on the same tick - your router, the ISP's access network, its domestic core, the relay, and a landmark on a different network in the same region - then names the one segment that is at fault. Reads the tunnel's own numbers from the service rather than opening a session of its own, so it is safe to run mid-match. Needs no Administrator. Each run writes a full report - trace, verdict and every raw sample - under `%LOCALAPPDATA%\GamePingBooster\lag-reports`, plus a one-line history entry that becomes the baseline later runs are judged against. |
| `./gpb capture [udp\|tcp\|all]` | Waits for the game to start, captures its traffic, and appends the server addresses it sees to `observed.txt`. Safe to Ctrl+C. `udp` is the default and the only half that feeds the profile. `tcp` is for a lobby stuck on "Initializing...": it lists every TCP destination the game tried, marks the ones whose SYNs were never answered as **BLOCKED**, and writes that to `tcp-sessions.txt` - never to `observed.txt`. `all` does both. Close downloads while capturing TCP; they fill the capture. |
| `./gpb profile` | Turns what `capture` collected into `profiles/pubg-vn.json`. No arguments. |
| `./gpb diag` | Collects everything needed to diagnose a client-side problem into one text file, with the PSK redacted - including the three newest `./gpb lag` reports, so the bundle can answer whether the network was bad at the time. Attach it to a bug report. |
| `./gpb installer [version]` | Publishes and then packages a setup `.exe` into `installer/dist/`. Needs [Inno Setup 6](https://jrsoftware.org/isdl.php). Give it a version to change one; see [Version](#version). |
| `./gpb version [x.y.z]` | Prints the version everything is stamped with, or sets it. |
| `./gpb reset` | **Deletes every trace of an installed Game Ping Booster from this machine**, so the installer can be tested on a development PC. See [Testing the installer](#testing-the-installer). |

`capture` and `profile` are a pair and are how the profile grows: play, capture, rebuild. A
profile is only as good as the number of matches behind it.

### Version

One number for the whole product, in the `VERSION` file at the root of `application/`.

`client/Directory.Build.props` reads it and stamps all four assemblies; `./gpb installer` reads
the same file and hands it to Inno Setup with `/DAppVersion`. So the setup filename, the entry in
Programs and Features, and the file properties of every `.exe` inside cannot disagree with each
other.

Change it as part of a build, which is when it matters:

```
./gpb installer 0.2.0        sets VERSION, then publishes and packages
./gpb version                prints what it is now
./gpb version 0.2.0          sets it without building anything
```

`x.y.z`, optionally with a suffix (`1.0.0-beta1`). The suffix reaches the product version and the
installer filename; the numeric part alone goes into `AssemblyVersion` and `FileVersion`, because
Windows will not accept anything else in a file version resource.

### Releasing

```
./gpb release 0.1.8
```

That is the whole procedure. It refuses, before changing anything, when: you are not on `main`,
there are uncommitted changes, `main` is behind `origin`, the tag already exists, or the version
is not newer than the latest release. It then shows what it will do and asks once. After the tag
is pushed, `.github/workflows/release.yml` builds the installer, the client zip and the relay
package, and creates the release with them attached.

**Never create or publish a release on the GitHub web page.** Releases on this repository are
immutable. A published release accepts no new assets, so one published by hand can never receive
the installer - and deleting it to try again makes its version number unusable forever. v0.1.7 was
lost that way. If a push fails part way, run the same `./gpb release` again: it recognises its own
release commit and tag and carries on from where it stopped.

### Testing the installer

An installer's job is to work on a machine that has never seen the software, and a development
machine is the opposite of that: the service is already registered, the Wintun driver is already
in the driver store, and there is already a device key, a licence token and a sealed profile.
Installing over all that exercises almost none of the steps that matter.

```
./gpb reset -DryRun          read what it would remove; runs without Administrator
./gpb reset                  do it; needs an Administrator terminal
./gpb reset -UseUninstaller  run the real uninstaller first, then sweep up what it missed
```

It removes the processes, the service, the firewall rule, the leftover routes, the virtual
adapter and the Wintun driver, everything under `%ProgramData%`, `%LOCALAPPDATA%` and
`%ProgramFiles%`, the shortcuts and the uninstall registry entry - then re-checks and prints
whatever survived.

Two things to know before the first run. It deletes `device.key`, so the machine becomes a **new
device** to the licence server and spends a device slot; every identity file is copied to
`.reset-backup/` first and `-KeepIdentity` skips the deletion. And it removes the Wintun driver,
which is shared with anything else that uses Wintun - WireGuard, most likely - so use
`-KeepDriver` if that applies to you.

### Both halves

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `./gpb test` | Everything: `gofmt`, `go vet`, the Go tests, the lag-verdict rules, then the C# build and the cross-language wire-format check. Skips the C# half with a warning if the .NET SDK is missing. |
| `./gpb release x.y.z` | **The only way to release.** Checks everything first, shows the plan and asks once, then bumps `VERSION`, commits, pushes `main` and the tag; GitHub Actions builds and publishes the release. See [Releasing](#releasing). |
| `./gpb help` | The same list, from the script itself. |

`./gpb test` always passes `-count=1`. Go's test cache is not keyed on
`testdata/protocol-vectors.json`, so without it a tampered vector file is reported as a cached
pass - which is the exact failure that file exists to catch. The whole suite takes about six
seconds from cold.

## Running it

1. Declare your VPS in `gpb.conf` (copy `gpb.conf.example`; it is gitignored), then
   `./gpb relay deploy`. See [relay/README.md](relay/README.md). Note the endpoint and PSK it
   prints - they go into two different files, as step 3 says.
2. Download the signed `wintun.dll` into `client/native/wintun/` - see
   [client/native/wintun/README.md](client/native/wintun/README.md).
3. Copy `client/config.example.json` to `client/config.json` and fill in the PSK. Set the relay
   from the app's Settings screen once it starts, or put its endpoint into `relayEndpoint` by
   hand.

   **Two files, and the split matters.** `config.json` is *this machine's settings* - the key,
   which relay to use, the adapter name. The profile is *content* - the game's IP ranges, and
   the relays the vendor offers. Keep your own relay out of the profile: a profile is replaced
   wholesale every time it is fetched from a server, so anything of yours written into it
   disappears silently on the next update.

   There are two ways to name a relay, and they are mutually exclusive:

   | Setting | Means |
   |---|---|
   | `defaultRelayId` | Use one of the relays the profile lists, by id. |
   | `relayEndpoints` | Use your own relays. **Replaces** the profile's list entirely - somebody running their own relays wants those, not a silent fallback to somebody else's. |

   `relayEndpoints` is a list, and giving it more than one is worth doing: the client measures
   every relay it knows before connecting and takes the fastest, then falls back to the others
   if that one stops answering. One address turns both of those off.

   `profilePath` is relative to the install directory and should stay that way; an absolute path
   only works on the machine it was written on. It is not in Settings on purpose - it is
   something the installer knows, not something a user should have to.
4. Build and start both halves:
   ```
   ./gpb dev
   ```
   The service has to run **as LocalSystem** - Wintun requires it and Administrator does not
   satisfy it - which is why this goes through `psexec` rather than just launching the exe. By
   hand, if you would rather:
   ```
   psexec -accepteula -s -i <path>\gpb-service.exe --console
   ```
5. Press Connect in `GamePingBooster.exe`.

`./gpb status` reads the tunnel's live counters, `./gpb logs` follows the service log, and
`./gpb check` answers whether the game is actually going through the relay - run that one during
a match.

Things that go wrong first, in order of likelihood:

- `WintunCreateAdapter` returns error 5 - the process is not actually running as LocalSystem.
  Check with `whoami`; it must print `nt authority\system`.
- The handshake never completes - the provider's cloud firewall is blocking the UDP port.
- Packets reach the relay but nothing comes back - `net.ipv4.ip_forward` is off, or `rp_filter`
  is still in strict mode.
- Small packets work but large ones hang - MTU or MSS clamping.

## Status

**The tunnel works end to end on real hardware** (verified 2026-08-30). Traffic goes from
Windows, through the Wintun adapter, through the relay on a VPS, out to the internet and back -
confirmed with both ICMP and TCP, the latter proving MSS clamping and stateful NAT on the return
path are correct.

It has since been played on. A three-hour PUBG session over the relay took the in-game ping
from **80 ms to 43 ms** and held it there (2026-09-02), and the installer has been run on a
machine that had never had the software, configured from the settings screen, and used for a
real match (2026-09-03).

Not yet done:

- **The profile is not saturated.** Roughly eight matches in ten land on a covered server. That
  only improves by playing and capturing; see `./gpb capture`.
- **The installer is not code signed.** SmartScreen warns everybody who runs it, and many will
  stop there. This needs a certificate that has to be bought, and it is the last thing between
  the build and somebody who is not the author.
- **The tunnel authenticates but does not encrypt.** See the security section of
  [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for what that costs and when it has to change.
